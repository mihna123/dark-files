Certainly, unraveling a dark past can add a layer of mystery and tension to your story. Here's how you might gradually reveal that the protagonist has a hidden, darker history:

    Cryptic Clues in Photographs: As the protagonist explores the pictures folder, they start noticing odd details in some of the photographs. Perhaps there are hints of places they don't remember visiting or people they can't place. These subtle discrepancies act as the first threads unraveling a hidden truth.

    Journal Entries: Alongside the pictures, the protagonist discovers a series of old journal entries saved on the laptop. These entries hint at events and emotions that seem out of place in their current life. Some passages convey darker thoughts and inner struggles, suggesting a complexity to their past that they can't recall.

    Anonymous Letters: Mixed in with the photographs and documents, the protagonist finds a series of handwritten letters, each more cryptic than the last. The letters allude to secrets, betrayals, and events that the protagonist doesn't remember. These letters become a trail of breadcrumbs leading to the truth.

    Hidden Rooms and Objects: The protagonist may stumble upon hidden rooms or compartments in their house that contain objects or documents that don't fit with their current life. A locked drawer with old newspaper clippings, a box of items from a seemingly unrelated life, or a hidden safe with incriminating evidence can be powerful tools for revealing the hidden past.

    Gaps in Memory: As the protagonist interacts with people from their past, they might start noticing that their friends and family are keeping things from them, or that they're acting strangely around certain topics. The protagonist's own memory gaps become a catalyst for uncovering secrets that others seem to know.

    Flashbacks and Nightmares: The protagonist might experience vivid flashbacks or disturbing nightmares that reveal fragments of their dark past. These dreams could be distorted and fragmented, forcing the protagonist to piece together the puzzle of their history.

    Confrontations and Conflicts: As the protagonist's investigation deepens, they could encounter individuals from their past who reveal uncomfortable truths. These confrontations might force the protagonist to confront their own actions and decisions, shedding light on their darker nature.

    Research and Investigations: The protagonist's determination to uncover the truth could lead them to research old news articles, police reports, or online archives. Through these investigations, they may uncover shocking events that they were involved in but have no memory of.

    Diaries or Tapes: The protagonist might discover old audio or video recordings, or diaries written by themselves during the time they can't remember. These firsthand accounts provide insight into the events they've forgotten.

    Revelatory Climax: Gradually, through these revelations, the protagonist comes to realize that they were involved in something deeply sinister. The climax of the story could involve a confrontation with their own actions and the moral reckoning of their past.

By layering these elements of discovery, you can create a slow-burning suspense that keeps readers engaged and invested in the protagonist's journey to uncover their dark past.
